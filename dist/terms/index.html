      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

      <div class="text-start">
        <p>
          <em>TL;DR:</em> This service is provided for your convenience, without
          any warranty of any kind. In an ideal world, if you use common sense,
          it will convert your document securely and privately, and this site
          will try it's best, but make no guarantees whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like any other website, your use of this service is subject to these
          terms, meaning if you use the service, you agree to be bound by these
          terms. That also means, that if you <em>do not</em> agree with all of
          the terms here, you may not use the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assuming, &quot;You&quot; are the person uploading a document to be
          converted (your &quot;Content&quot;), and &quot;the Service&quot; is
          the website you are currently on to convert your Content,
          specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Don't use this Service for anything illegal. Don't try to hack or
            overburden the Service. Don't use it to harm others.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not use this Service if you are under 13 years old. Explain
            to your parents what Markdown is and have them use the Service on
            your behalf.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Content you upload to be converted is your Content and you are
            responsible for it and any harm that it may cause to yourself or
            others.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Service doesn't claim any ownership in the original Content or
            Markdown conversion. You, however, do claim that you have a right to
            possess and convert the Content. If you don't, don't use this
            service to convert it. If Content you upload infringes on the rights
            of others, that's on you.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Service does not review your Content nor the Content of others,
            nor does it endorse any Content uploaded or converted. You're
            responsible for ensuring the Content or converted Content doesn't
            harm your computer (or anyone else's).
          </li>
          <li>
            You use this Service at your own risk and it might break or cease to
            exist at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
